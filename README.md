# Premier League Statistics

This app was built using React for the frontend, and NodeJS (REST API with Express) for the backend. The dataset I used contained statistics from the PL seasons 2000-01 up until 2021-22, and I created two endpoints for it: one containing all seasons, and one for each selected season to be displayed in the frontend. 

The project can be seen here:

The backend is here:
